# GitTrackr

GitTrackr is an application designed to assist educators in evaluating student contributions on GitHub. This application allows educators to compare repository statistics and provides a comprehensive overview of student contributions.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Repository Statistics Comparison**:
  
  The primary function of GitTrackr is to compare the statistics of repositories that have been added to a previous folder.
- **Detailed Repository Information**:
  
  This feature enables educators to access detailed information about a repository and compare the contribution statistics of developers involved in a project.
- **Student Performance Evaluation**:
  
  With GitTrackr, educators can readily identify students who have made frequent contributions to a project and those who have not contributed at all. This information proves invaluable in evaluating individual student performance and providing feedback.
- **Overview of Student Contributions**:
  
  GitTrackr offers a comprehensive overview of student contributions, thereby enabling educators to make informed assessments and identify areas where students may require additional support or guidance.
